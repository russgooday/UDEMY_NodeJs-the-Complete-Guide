#### Work on the course and this repository
There is a great deal of material to take in on this course — an almost overwhelming amount. 

Rather than waiting for the end of section assignments, I will code along the way testing to see if I have taken in what has been taught so far. Furthermore, with a bit of research, I like to see if I can solve a problem ahead of the tutor's explanation.

I have come unstuck a few times with these deviations, but on other occassions have been able to find noteworthy alternatives to a problem. Either way it has been helpful way of learning and retaining the course material.

This repository consists of those solutions and assignments.
