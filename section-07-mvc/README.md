## The Model View Controller (MVC)

#### Models
* Represent your data in your code
* Work with your data ( e.g. save fetch )

#### Views
* What the user sees ( The rendered output. e.g. Outputted with EJS, PUG, Handlebars, HTML etc )
* Decoupled from your application code

#### Routes and Controllers
##### Routes
Routes decide upon which path or which http method (POST GET) which controller is executed

##### Controllers
* Connecting your Models and your Views
* Contain the *in-between* logic
