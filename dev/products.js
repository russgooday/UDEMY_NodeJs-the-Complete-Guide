    published: 'July 11th 1994',

    summary: 'Abhorrently dark and raw to the core, Trainspotting will always be a cult classic.',
    description: "<p>'An unremitting powerhouse of a novel that marks the arrival of a major new talent. Trainspotting is a loosely knotted string of jagged, dislocated tales that lay bare the hearts of darkness of the junkies, wide-boys and psychos who ride in the down escalator of opportunity in the nation's capital. Loud with laughter in the dark, this novel is the real McCoy. If you haven't heard of Irvine Welsh before-don't worry, you will' The Herald</p>\n",

    summary: 'A brilliant book, barmy and barnacled with the grotesque â€” read it if your dare.',
    description: '<p>The Wasp Factory is a work of horrifying compulsion: horrifying, because it enters a mind whose realities are not our own, whose values of life and death are alien to our society; compulsive, because the humour and compassion of that mind reach out to us all. A novel of extraordinary originality, imagination and comic ferocity.</p>\n',
